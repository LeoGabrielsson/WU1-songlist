            <h3>Lost Chapter</h3>
            <p>
                Boundless shadows, land of the hundred czars<br>
                Hallowed warriors, rest beneath the stars<br>
                No more we ever speak<br>
                Of fields of reckoning<br>
                No voice calling, from the dark<br>
                Names of gold<br>
                Forged in wars of old
            </p>
            <p>
                The memory remains<br>
                A vision of endless misery
                <br>
                Woes of ours in vein
            </p>
            <p>
                Sons of Minerva, the fortune of the realm<br>
                Call on our savior, to wipe out all the traitors<br>
                The Earth trembles as we gather ashore<br>
                For the lands we swore to hold<br>
                For our kingdom glorious
            </p>
            <p>
                Yeah<br>
                Endless demons, found us overnight<br>
                Still we're standing, basking in the light
            </p>
            <p>
                No more we ever speak<br>
                Of fields of reckoning<br>
                No voice calling, from the dark<br>
                Days of old<br>
                Wars victorious
            </p>
            <p>
                The memory remains<br>
                Worlds falling a-way
            </p>
            <p>
                Sons of Minerva, the fortune of the realm<br>
                Call on our savior, to wipe out all the traitors<br>
                The Earth trembled as we gathered ashore<br>
                For the lands we swore to hold<br>
                For our kingdom glorious

                You are no different, you're animals<br>
                You are but momentary flaws<br>
                You are a dying world<br>
                We are your death reborn<br>
                Welcome to your new reality<br>
                Silence the weak morality<br>
                We bring a lifeless existence<br>
                We're seeking to end it all lifeblood of this world
            </p>

                So look beyond and witness pain

            <p>
                You are inferior, you're fallible<br>
                You are just temporary souls<br>
                You are just simple forms<br>
                We are your death reborn<br>
                We bring fire, we bring pain endlessly<br>
                Make good with death, morality<br>
                We're children of soulless death entities<br>
